Instructions to Implement:

Interval Tree class contains Insert , Check overlap , Delete and search functions.
I am checking the overlap of rectangle cordinates with all tree nodes before inserting.
Step 1: In putty enter the path for the folder where all attached files are.
In CMD
Step 2: Cd /"file path"/ 
Step 3: ./check.sh filename
Step 4: It will Display the result of input files.
Step 5: Input File name to check should be any of the given filename among 5 overlapfiles and 2 no overlap files as srgument to 
check.sh.

IN buildOverlappingRect.sh I am calling class files inordertree.java and inorderNode.java
